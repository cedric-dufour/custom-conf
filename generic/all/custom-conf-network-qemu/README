Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-network-qemu

This package provides standard configuration of a QEMU/KVM dedicated bridge
and corresponding TAP interfaces, for (direct) use by the QEMU command-line
emulator.

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - bridge routing (Layer-2 bridge, Layer-3 NAT or no routing)
 - along corresponding IP tables rules
 - and utilities to seamlessly add/delete all corresponding
   networking resources

Please note this is NOT intended as a production tool/environment and aims
at providing developers a fast and easy mean to setup QEMU (minimalistic)
networking, e.g. on one's laptop.
