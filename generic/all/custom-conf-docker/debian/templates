 * 1-4096
 .
   Kernel user namespace is enabled. UIDs/GIDs are shifted according to
   1'000'000x the specified value. You MUST pull all Docker images anew

Template: custom-conf-docker/syslog-listen
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Have local syslog daemon listen to containers syslog traffic ?
