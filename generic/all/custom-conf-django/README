Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-django

This package provides standard configuration of the Django web framework,
version 1.4 and 1.7 (automatically detected).

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - Apache2 integration provisioning (<-> 'custom-conf-apache2' package)
 - logging (<-> 'logrotate' package)

It also provides a starter (maybe just example) skeleton to have a Django
application jump-started correspondingly (through WSGI).
