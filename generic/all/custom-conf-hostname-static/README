Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-hostname-static

This package provides standard (static) configuration of the hostname.

Currently, it consists only of making sure that the dynamic/DHCP counterpart
package is not installed, such as to keep the hostname configuration untouched.
