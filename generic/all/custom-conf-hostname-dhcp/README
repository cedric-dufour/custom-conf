Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-hostname-dhcp

This package provides standard (dynamic) configuration of the hostname.

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - the hostname, dynamically, based on the DHCP-assigned IP address
   and the corresponding reverse DNS resolution
 - re-configuring the 'custom-conf' packages that may depend of the
   hostname
