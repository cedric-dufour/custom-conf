Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-opensc

This package provides standard configuration of the Open SmartCard
(OpenSC) stack, along PKCS#11 add-ons.

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - generic smartcards usage for authentication and encryption/signature,
   along common Linux setups: PAM, Kerberos, Firefox/Thunderbird/Chromium,
   etc.

Noteworthy:
 - WARNING: this configuration may prove inappropriate for specialized
   applications with high security requirements, since some compromises
   have been made to leverage user experience vs (stringent) security
 - WARNING: at the time of writing, it is highly recommended to use the
   following Debian/Buster (backported) packages to avoid a few bugs:
   - libccid >= 1.4.27 (<-> HID 5x22 readers)
   - opensc >= 0.18 (<-> Aventry MyEID smartcards)
