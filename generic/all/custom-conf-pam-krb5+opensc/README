Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-pam-krb5+opensc

This package provides standard configuration of the Pluggable Authentication
Modules (PAM) stack along MIT Kerberos V and OpenSC (PKCS#11) authentication

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - Mandatory PKCS#11 (OpenSC) authentication
 - LDAP integration (<-> 'custom-conf-nss' package)
 - Kerberos integration (<-> 'custom-conf-krb5' package)
 - Kerberos authentication quirks
 - SmartCard event manager (<-> session securing on removal)

Noteworthy:
 - The SmartCard certificate is assumed to store the username in its subject's
   Common Name (CN)
 - MIT Kerberos V does NOT allow to *enforce* PKINIT and will always revert
   to password authentication if the former fails; the only way to *enforce*
   SmartCard authentication is thus by the  way of 'pam_pkcs11'
 - In order to avoid weird user experiences - e.g. when Gnome Keyring PAM
   integration is enabled - authentication must end with the user *password*
   stored in the PAM stack (and NOT the SmartCard PIN code); this is unfortu-
   nate but see this as "two+"-factor authentication
 - WARNING: at the time of writing, 'pam_pkcs11' segfaults when attempting any
   type of Certificates Revocation List (CRL) check! Performing no CRL checks
   is however leveraged by password authentication being required.
