Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-conf-iptables

This package provides standard configuration of IPv4/IPv6 firewall rules
(iptables).

In particular, it addresses standard configuration of:
 - blocking non-routable subnets
 - blocking port scans
 - blocking stealth scans
 - throttling (anti-DoS) common ports
 - white-/black-listing specific subnets/hosts (<-> 'custom-defs-...' package)
 - easy addition of rules and hooks (<-> other 'custom-conf-...' packages)
