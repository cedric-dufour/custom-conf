Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================

The Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf) is a mean of applying
configuration customizations by the way of Debian packaging.

Rather than using complex deployment frameworks that may be overkill for small
setups, the Custom Configuration Framework uses the features provided by
Debian packages to achieve its purpose, namely:
 - packages dependencies
 - automated files installation
 - post-installation scripts
along the GIT-based Configuration Tracking Utility (GCFG) for the purpose of
tracking configuration changes made to the "vanilla" setup.

In order to provide a consistent base across all configuration packages, the
Custom Configuration Framework also relies on a user-specific definitions
package ('custom-defs-...'), which provides, in a single place, the various
parameters specific to a user (or network segment):
 - default network range and gateway (IPv4/IPv6)
 - DNS IP addresses
 - NTP server names
 - LDAP server URLs
 - etc.

The Custom Configuration Framework is thus split in two parts:
 - a 'generic' part, which contains configuration packages that have no
   specific parameters (except those polled from the 'custom-defs-...'
   package)
 - a user-specific part, named 'example.org' for the sake of examples,
   which contains configuration packages that are specific to a user,
   including the 'custom-defs-...' package

Each part is then subdivided in a set of directories that allow to target
a specific distributor/distribution:
 - the 'all' directory is the most generic (and where one should strive to
   have most packages)
 - the 'debian' directory, targeted towards Debian distributions
 - the 'jessie' (or 'wheezy' or ...) directory, targeted towards a
   specific Debian distribution version

Please bear with me that the 'generic' part is actually pretty specific to my
personal requirements and preferences in regards with the various configuration
customizations.
But feel free to fork and customize that 'generic' part to match your agenda!
