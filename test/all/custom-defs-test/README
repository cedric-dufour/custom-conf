Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
============================================
Package: custom-defs-test

This package contains TEST environment parameters definitions:
 - default network range and gateway (IPv4/IPv6)
    net 192.168.169.0/24 / fec0::c0ff:fea8:a900/120
    via 192.168.169.1    / fec0::c0ff:fea8:a901
 - within the ".test" (RFC 2606) DNS domain

It assumes a "master" server is available:
 - IPv4/IPv6 addresses
    net 192.168.169.2 / fec0::c0ff:fea8:a902
 - providing the following services (at least):
    dns.test
    syslog.test
 - and resolving (as DNS, provided such service are necessary):
    ntp.test
    ldap.test
    krb5.test
    smtp.test
    cups.test
