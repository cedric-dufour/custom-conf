web server document ('htdocs') directory along the utilities required to manage it
('dpkg/*' and 'debmirror/*').

Custom packages ought to be placed in the matching 'binary' or 'source' sub-direc-
tory and the correponding 'dpkg' utility executed to update the repository index.

Official Debian packages can be mirrored using the supplied 'debmirror' scripts.
