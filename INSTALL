Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf) - Installation
===========================================================

Being based on Debian packages, the Custom Configuration Framework (custom-conf)
is built simply by going into each configuration package directory and run
the 'dpkg-buildpackage' command (part of the official 'dpkg-dev' package):

  # Install Debian packages utilities
  apt-get install build-essential debhelper dpkg-dev

  # Switch to the configuration package directory
  $ cd generic/all/custom-conf

  # Build the package (here unsigned)
  $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b

  # Look for the package in the parent directory
  $ ls -l ../*.deb

  # Clean-up
  $ dh clean


The resulting package can then be installed on the target host using the usual
Debian commands:

  # Install the package "manually"
  $ dpkg -i <package>.deb

  # Install the package via a custom APT repository
  $ apt-get install <package>


To install the package via a custom APT repository, have a look at the
'custom-conf-apt' package in the 'example.org' directory, which README file
shall give you directions on how to setup such a thing.

Of course, the examples provided in the 'example.org' directory MUST be tuned
to fit your specific setup, in particular the 'custom-defs-...' package(s).
